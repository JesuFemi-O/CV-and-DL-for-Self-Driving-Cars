# CV-and-DL-for-Self-Driving-Cars :oncoming_automobile: :oncoming_automobile:
Started working on computer vision and deep learning with Tensorflow 2.0 and decided to do a few things around self driving cars

## What I would be working on in this repo :v:
Looking to explore a few mini projects around the topic ranging from:
- Lane line detection with OpenCV (a detailed notebook explaining the Algorithm and an example showing challenges i faced and tricks i used)
- Traffic sign classification. Again the goal would be to show challenges i faced and techniques I adopted to fix them.
- Behavioural Cloning (Looking to publish a notebook and possibly custom generated data i used in creating a model to teach a car to drive around a simulator)

## Credits :raised_hands:
- I learnt a ton of stuff from Ryan Ahmed via is deep learning and computer vision course and this repo is a result of deep practice to drive home the concepts
- Big thank you to my very weird friend, Precious for contnously pushing me.

## Have fun! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

- Please feel free to reuse the codes in this repo if the need arises. cheers.
